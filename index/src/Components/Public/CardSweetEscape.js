                    <p className="card-text">"'The Sweet Escape' is probably the easiest track. It's not a track that makes you say, 'Oh, what's this?'' It's very easy for people to like that song, because there is nothing really crazy going on. Itâ€™s just a great riff and good chorus. My fans heard me play the rough idea of it a year ago and the reaction was insane, so I was really happy to finally give it to them now" said Alesso. This was premiered at his Ultra 2014 performance and was played on Radio 1 by none other than Danny Howard.</p>
